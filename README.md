# Customization
You can customize the music name, author and soundtrack by creating a file called `musics.json` under `./assets/musicnotification/musics.json` of your ressource pack.

See [musics.json](https://github.com/KosmoMoustache/MusicNotification/blob/main/src/main/resources/assets/musicnotification/musics.json) for the default file.
To add a new music, add a new object in the json file with the following format:
```json
{
  "sound identifier": {
    "name": "Music name",
    "author": "Music author",
    "soundtrack": "Soundtrack name",
    "cover": "File name without extension",
    "isRandom": "true/false", // Not currently used
    "identifier": "Identifier to play this sound" // Not currently used
  }
}
```
The cover image need to be placed under the `./assets/musicnotification/textures/gui/sprites/toast/` folder of your ressource pack.
if you have any question feel free to fill an issue.
